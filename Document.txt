Property:
color: varieties--rgb, rgba, hsl, hex

Types of colors: 
use colorpicker from google
background-color, background-image
background-repeat:no-repeat/repeat(default)
background-size:cover/contain
you can use just background to specify any thing related to background
opacity:shading
Gradients:transition between colors(circle, linear)
linear-graient(to right/left/top/bottom/bottom right/ you can give degrees also etc)




Types of Units:
absolute: inch, cm, mm, -won't affect by anything around them
relative:%, em, vw, vh--affect by parent element or by surrounding elements
view-port-relative to body width/height
px, pt, pc  is absolute but relative to screen
better use relative units if you are going to use in different devices

Text manipulation:
text-decoration:none,underline,line-through,overline
text-transform:
Font manipulation:
font-style
font-weight
font-size
external fonts from google

CSS Box model:
content, padding, border, margin
use relative units for width and absolute units for height
border: thickness style(dotted, solid) color

Display and Float properties:
Manipulate website
display:--block, inline, none, inline-block
float:--right, left, inherit

CSS Flexbox:
two parts: container, flex elements
use properties to manipulate the container and items
layout

display:flex
flex-direction: column, column-reverse, row, row-reverse
flex-wrap: wrap, no wrap, wrap-reverse
horizontal--justify-content: center, flex-end, space-around, space-between
order:
flex-grow, flex-basis, flex-shrink
flex-grow: tells how much space the item takes indide the container
When you go minimum width then it goes to default value of flex-shrink
that's where you use shrink to tell don't shrink the flex-grow item
flex-shrink default is 1
flex-grow default is 0
if you give flex-shrink value to 3 then that item shrinks three times faster than other items
see the shrink effect by resizing the window

align-self overides align-items:align-self:center,flex-start,flex-end

Grid VS Flexbox:
grid works on both directions(width+height)
Flexbox works mainly on width

Grid:
grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows
you can use auto as default value. the grid adjusts the rows/column sizes
Justify-content: center, start, end,space-around, space-evenly
align-content:space-between, space-evenly, start, end, center
grid-column-gap, grid-row-gap, grid-gap
grid-column, grid-row:1/2 or 1/span 2
grid-area:column start row start column end row end


Transition:
for all browser support use -webkit-transition/ -moz- / -o-
transition: all 1s ease
Transform:translate, skew, rotate, scale

matrix-takes 6 values(scalex, skewx, skewy, scaley, translatex, translatey) -rotate don't work with matrix

Animation:
@keyframe
  animation-name: animation-duration: 4s;animation-timing-function: ease;
   animation-delay: 2s; animation-iteration-count: 2, animation-direction:normal, reverse, alternate, alternate-reverse
   shothand: animation:takes 5 values(name, duration, timing, delay, iteration count, direction)
